# Data types

While developing applications in the C# language, you could use various data types divided into two groups, namely **value types** and **reference types**. 
The difference between them is straightforwardâ€”a variable of a value type directly contains data, while a variable of a reference type stores a reference to data, as shown as follows:
As you can see, a Value type stores its actual Value directly in the Stack memory, while a Reference type only stores a Reference here. The actual Value is located in the Heap memory. Therefore, it is also possible to have two or more variables of a reference type that reference the same Value.

# Arrays
When you want to store a set of variables, you can use **Arrays**. When you face arrays, you sometimes need to **Sort** them. There are some familiar sorting algorithms, such as :
**Selection sort**, **Insertion sort**, **Bubble sort**, and **Quick sort**.

## Selection sort
Selection sort is the most straightforward sorting algorithm. The algorithm divides the array into two parts, namely **sorted** and **unsorted**. In the following iterations, the algorithm finds the **smallest** element in the unsorted part and exchanges it with the first element in the unsorted part. Before writing code, let's sort an array with nine elements [-11, 12, -42, 0, 1, 90, 68, 6, -9].

At the first step of algorithm **(i=0)**, we consider the sorted part of the array empty. We consider the i*th* index of the array as the minimum Value. Try to sweep at the rest elements of the array with the *m* index that starts from **i+1** and find the minimum value of the array by comparing each element with minValue. In each iteration, compare the element's value with minValue, and substitute it with minValue.
In the preceding code, you can find the implementation of ascending sort for a generic array.

```
public class SelectionSort<T> : IArraySorter<T> where T : IComparable
    {
        public T[] AscendingSort(T[] array)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < array.Length - 1; i++)
            {
                int minIndex = i;
                T minValue = array[i];
                for (int j = i + 1; j < array.Length; j++)
                {
                    if (array[j].CompareTo(minValue) < 0)
                    {
                        minIndex = j;
                        minValue = array[j];
                    }
                }
                Utilities.Swap(array, i, minIndex);
            }

            return array;
        }
```
