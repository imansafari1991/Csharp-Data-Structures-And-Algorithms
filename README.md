**Data types**

While developing applications in the C# language, you could use various data types, which are divided into two groups, namely **value types** and **reference types**. 
The difference between them is very simpleâ€”a variable of a value type directly contains data, while a variable of a reference type just stores a reference to data, as shown as follows:
As you can see, a Value type stores its actual Value directly in the Stack memory, while a Reference type only stores a Reference here. The actual value is located in the Heap memory. Therefore, it is also possible to have two or more variables of a reference type that reference exactly the same value.
